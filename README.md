Hello there.... as of 2021, I have concluded my journey in the pursuit of becoming an expert coder. I honestly feel no regret on letting go my favorite hobby. I have learnt so much from so many great people. I have created countless discord bots for other people and for myself, which have been inactive for 2+ years. Thank you to the people who have supported me in this journey...
